      <p class="text">In an interview, talking about what 'your greatest weakness' or flaw is difficult. We're here to make it easier.
         Today, I want to talk about one of the most common and aggravating interview questions of them all: What is your
         greatest weakness?<br>
         'Are you rolling your eyes?' Most candidates hate this question and consider it pointless. After all, they
         aren't about
         to confess candidly to their biggest flaws in the middle of a job interview. <br>
         However, this question has become a cliché for a reason. Interviewers continue to ask it even though they know
         they are
         unlikely to get answers that are 100% honest <br>
         Why? Because the way you answer a question about your weaknesses is very telling. You may not even realize what
         you are
         communicating when you answer this question. <br>
         And let's face it, you're 'probably doing it wrong'. Most people do. I say that as an interview coach who has
         now worked
         with thousands of job seekers. At least 90% of my clients need help with answering the 'weakness' question.
